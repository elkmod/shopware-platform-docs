# Developer documentation - Iteration 2

**This is a WIP of a new iteration of the documentation. For the actual/current documentation please look at the `current` directory.**

We are currently working on improving the developer documentation. The goal is simplify the structure and provide the information based on specific use-cases rather then larger how-tos including multiple topics. The existing how-tos and tutorials will remain or will be migrated to smaller guides.

The new structure:
* System guide (Installation process, requirements etc.)
* Developer guide (Developing plugins)
* Theme guide (Developing themes, only theme specific content here)
* API guide (Usage of the API ignoring other stuff)
* How Tos (Existing how tos)
* References and internals (Reference documentation, e.g. all CLI commands)
* Contribution (How to contribute to Shopware 6, deprecations etc.)
