# This is our new Developer Home

**This is a WIP of a new iteration of the documentation. For the actual/current documentation please look at the `current` directory.**

We are currently working on improving the developer documentation. The goal is simplify the structure and provide the information based on specific use-cases rather then larger how-tos including multiple topics. The existing how-tos and tutorials will remain or will be migrated to smaller guides.

The new structure:

* System guide \(Installation process, requirements etc.\)
* Developer guide \(Developing plugins\)
* Theme guide \(Developing themes, only theme specific content here\)
* API guide \(Usage of the API ignoring other stuff\)
* How Tos \(Existing how tos\)
* References and internals \(Reference documentation, e.g. all CLI commands\)
* Contribution \(How to contribute to Shopware 6, deprecations etc.\)
